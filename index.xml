      <description>Overview I&amp;rsquo;m a University Distinguished Professor and Lucas-Rathbone Professor of Engineering (brief bio sketch,full CV) in the Computer Science Department at Kansas State University, and (along with Professor Robby) I lead the laboratory for Specification, Analysis, and Transformation of Software (SAnToS). SAnToS aims to develop and mature technologies and tools for effective construction of high-confidence software systems.
SAnToS Laboratory emphasizes a research methodology in which research advances are achieved by building robust tools that can be applied to and evaluated against real systems in the context of realistic development practices, and then using insights gained in these evaluations to guide future research directions and priorities.</description>

      <description>Projects Current HAMR - lead architect of HAMR (High-Assurance Modeling and Rapid engineering) - a model-driven development framework for high-assurance systems. HAMR is being used in several of US Department of Defense research projects (AFRL, US Army, DARPA). See one of my overview talks on HAMR
Slang and Logika - I support my colleague Professor Robby, in the use and application of Slang (a high-assurance of Scala) and Logika (a highly automated and user-friendly code contract verification tool for Slang).</description>

      <description>Teaching CIS 301: Logical Foundations of Programming
This course teaches the basic elements found in a formal logic including syntax for claims and rules for making deductions, as well as on how to judge if the rules are suitable in the sense that they only lead to claims that match the reality of the domain that are being reasoned. The focus will be on formal logics for reasoning about program behavior.</description>
